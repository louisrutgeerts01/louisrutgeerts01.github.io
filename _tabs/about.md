# About Me

Hi, I’m **Louis Rutgeerts** — a Master’s student in **Mathematical Engineering at KU Leuven**.  
I have strong interests in **statistics, data science, and quantitative finance**, and my work often combines **stochastic modeling** with **optimization techniques** to solve practical problems in applied mathematics.
